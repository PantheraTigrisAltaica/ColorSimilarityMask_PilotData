# ColorSimilarityMask_PilotData
Pilot 1: 50ms color stimuli, 50ms backward masking, saturation = 1
Color duration: 17ms color stimuli, 50ms backward masking, saturation = 1
Forward masking: 17ms color stimuli, 50ms backward masking, 50ms forward masking, saturation = 1
Saturation: 50ms color stimuli, 50ms backward masking, saturation = 0.5
Always 100ms gap between color stimuli and backward masking for weak masking condition and no gap for strong masking condition
